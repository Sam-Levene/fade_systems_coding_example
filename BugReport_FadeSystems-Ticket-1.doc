Bug Report: Defect for Scenario around deleting entries from the table.
System: Microsoft Windows 11
Browser: Google Chrome / Opera / Firefox / Microsoft Edge
Description: When testing the http://fade-qa-test.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ website; using the scenarios outlined in the brief; I encountered an issue with this scenario where there is no way to delete an entry from the table of registered users once a user has been added.
Scenario: Scenario 4: A user is able to delete a form entry they previously made on the table
Given a user is on their browser
When the user navigates to the website
And the user fills in the form correctly with email present
When the user deletes their data from the table
Then the data is removed from the table

Steps taken:
1. Navigate to the website http://fade-qa-test.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/
2. Fill in the form with valid user details and click on the Register button
3. Attempt to delete the entry by clicking on the delete button in the row

Expected Outcome:
Delete button exists and upon clicking the button; the entry should be deleted

Actual Outcome:
No delete button exists in the row; therefore the entry cannot be deleted.
